    \class  NACC_DateCalc
    \brief  This is the fundamental core of the cleantme calculator.

            It works by taking an input date (1-day resolution), and a "today" date (which can be
            omitted), and calculates the time interval between them. It uses the appropriate
            calendar (if Iranian, it uses the Persian Solar Calendar).
            All the action happens in the designated initializer. Once the class is instantiated,
            its work is done.
