    MAIN LOCALIZATION FILE

    This file contains all the strings that are displayed in the NACC app.

    The app is designed to be entirely localizable, so no strings are included
    in the main app. Instead, we use keys and the NSLocalizedString function to
    develop the displayed strings. Whatever is written here, will be displayed
    in the app.

    It is important that this file be UTF-8 encoded. Xcode has a bug, where it keeps
    saving these as UTF-16. If this happens, you will see a bunch of upside-down
    question marks (¿) displayed, if viewed in Xcode. It will probably display fine
    in other text editors.
 
    You localize these strings by changing the string in the RIGHT side of the "=".
 
    DO NOT CHANGE THE LEFT SIDE!
 
    Only change the string on the right.

      DO NOT CHANGE                                 CHANGE
           |                                           |
           |                                           |
